### Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem solving with metaheuristics

The capacitated vehicle routing problem (also known as a CVRP) is one of many vehicle routing problems (VRPs.) These are a set of challenges that trucking and delivery businesses face in which route optimization is needed but challenging to obtain. This specific VRP, the CVRP, focuses on creating the ideal route for each vehicle of a fleet so that the maximum amount of deliveries takes place and the maximum amount of cargo space is used.

There are many variables to consider for the optimization problem. Each vehicle has a limited carrying capacity, which is measured both by cubic volume and weight. In addition, other factors like fuel usage, driver schedule, and priority must be considered with each package and route.

In the ideal world, solving the problem means each driver and truck using 100% of the capacity and minimizing fuel usage or travel time to create maximum profits. However, it never works out like that. In reality, one truck might only use 60% of its capacity while using a lot of fuel, while another uses 90% and an average amount of fuel.

In this project, we are trying to solve this problem, using several algorithm with Java :
* Hill-Climbing
* Simulated Annealing
* Tabu search
* Genetical algorithms
* Evolutionary algorithms
* Ant system
